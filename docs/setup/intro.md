# Intro

RaspiBlitz is optimized to run on RaspberryPi 4&5 and needs at least a 1TB external storage. To setup hardware & software follow this tutorial.

:::info
To run RaspiBlitz in a Virtual Machine, Proxmox or on an old laptop (experimental) check [Alternative Platforms](https://github.com/raspiblitz/raspiblitz/blob/dev/alternative.platforms/README.md).

## Setup Time Estimate

In a prepared workshop at a hackday or conference (see [detailed workshop tutorial](../community/workshops.md)) or when it comes fully assembled with an up-to-date synced blockchain, it's possible to have a RaspiBlitz ready in about 1 hour.

But normally if you start at home ordering the parts from Amazon (see shopping list in next chapter) then it's a weekend project with a lot of downloading and syncing time where you can do other stuff while checking on the progress from time to time.

So lets get started and take a look at your [Hardware Setup](get-hardware.md).

:::info
If you already run a Umbrel, Citadel or myNode you have basically all the hardware needed and you can make the [Migration to RaspiBlitz from Umbrel/Citadel/myNode](migrate.md) under one hour.
