# Migrate

:::info
If you want to update from an older version of the RaspiBlitz software, you should follow [these instructions](./software-setup/2_basic.md)
:::

:::warning
**Important Notice for v1.12.0**: Due to the new drive layout introduced in RaspiBlitz v1.12.0 (which supports booting from NVMe), migration from Umbrel, MyNode, and Citadel is no longer supported. If you need to migrate from these platforms, please use an older version of RaspiBlitz first, then upgrade to v1.12.0.
:::

The migration functionality that was previously available for other node software has been removed in v1.12.0 to make way for the new flexible drive layout system.
